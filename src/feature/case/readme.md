## Case Feature

This is a feature defining the logic surrounding the concept of a 'case'

This is an organizational concept.

Often, redux applications are organized such that files which serve similar purposes are grouped together.

i.e., all actions are in one folder, all reducers are another, etc.

This generally leads to more confusion and complexity when working on an application.

Generally, when working on making a change to an application, the changes are never
constrained to just one, but all of them.

So if I were to to want change something about how cases are handled, I have to find the relevant files
in each of the appropriate directories.

With this system, they are bunched together, making the job of finding all files which need to be worked on together 
simpler
